# 👋 Hi, I'm Hitesh Dhruna

I'm a **Platform Engineer** based in Berlin, focused on building and scaling modern infrastructure that helps developers ship reliable software faster.  
With over 15 years of experience in **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD automation**, and **cloud platforms**, I specialize in bridging infrastructure and developer experience — from build pipelines to production reliability.

---

## 🧭 What I Do

- Design, maintain, and scale **developer platforms** that simplify service delivery across teams.  
- Improve **CI/CD reliability and security**, with strong focus on GitHub Actions lifecycle management.  
- Implement **infrastructure automation** and environment consistency through **Terraform** and GitOps patterns.  
- Drive **observability and platform performance** through proactive resource tuning and metrics analysis.  
- Collaborate across engineering, platform, and security teams to keep systems performant and compliant.

## ⚙️ Current Focus
At **Priceline**, I work on the **Developer Platform Engineering** team — maintaining internal CI/CD and container infrastructure, upgrading build systems, and supporting secure, reliable service deployments at scale.

Previously at **Flyiin GmbH**, I was the **sole DevOps and InfraOps engineer**, managing infrastructure automation, Kubernetes environments, and production observability.
